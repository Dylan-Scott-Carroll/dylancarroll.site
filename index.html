                    <h3>Who I am</h3>
                    <p>I grew up  in the Seattle area of Washington state, and attended Inglemoor High School. I became interested in computer programming at a young age and to this day consider computer programming as my main hobby.</p>

                    
                    <p> I first taught myself Python at age 14, sparking a lifelong passion for programming. In college at Western Washington University, I have expanded my skills across Python, Java, C#, C, C++, and other languages. </p>

                    <p> I will graduate with my Bachelor's in Computer Science in June 2024 and currently have a 4.0 GPA. Additionally, I am on track to begin pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at WWU in Fall 2024. </p>

                    <p> I am currently seeking a Summer 2024 software engineering internship to complement my education with hands-on experience before starting my graduate studies. </p>

                    <p> Previously, I interned at The International Society for Optics and Photonics, where I developed robust test automation frameworks in C# and Postman/JavaScript. I also gained valuable web development experience building accessible websites with HTML/CSS during my internship as a Web Developer for WWU. </p>

                    <p> In addition to professional experience, I have served as a CS tutor and mentor for over 50 students, instructing them in algorithms, data structures, software design, and other core computer science topics. </p>

                    <p> With my strong technical aptitude, 4.0 GPA, and a lifelong passion for coding, I'm eager to gain more real-world experience through a software engineering internship next summer. Please view my full resume to see more details about my education, experience, and coding projects. </p>

                    <p> You can also find some of my hobby programming projects on my personal website: https://dylancarroll.net/programming. </p>         

                    <br>

                    <h3>Hire Me</h3>
                    <p>I am currently seeking computer science and software related internships for the summer of 2024. I am a qualified and experienced, an candidate that would make a valuable addition to any team.   </p>
