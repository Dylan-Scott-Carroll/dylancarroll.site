                    <h1>Programming </h1>


                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>I first learned to program when I taught myself Python by following an online tutorial in 2015. I often programmed as a hobby and made simple console-based projects to mess around with programming.
                    <p>In 2017, which was my sophomore year of high school, I enrolled in my first official computer-science course. The course was based in C# and the .net framework and introduced me to more structured programming practices and more advanced concepts. I continued to write mostly in Python for my hobby projects because I was still more comfortable with that language.</p>
                    <p>That same year, I learned how to write BASIC for my TI-84 plus mainly as a way to program in math class. I wrote simple games, math tools, and tech demos. Some of the programs I wrote include: Snake, a program that factors quadratics, and a Mandelbrot fractal renderer. This is not an important skill, but it was a fun part of the hobby to mess around in such a limited language with limited harware and to see what I could get it to do.</p>
                    <p>In 2019 I began to teach myself C and C++ to familiarize myself with lower-level programming concepts, increase the number of languages knew, and gain access to a faster language for resource-heavy projects.</p>
                    <p>2019-2020 was my freshman year at Western Washington University. I was accepted into the “Computer Science Distinguished Scholars Program” and took CS 141, 145, and 241. The first of which was a Python course. During CS 241 I declared the computer science pre-major.</p>
                
                    <br>

                    <h2>Independant projects</h2>
                    
                    <p> This is an incomplete list of my favorite projects that I have completed in my own time as a hobby. I am still working on documenting the rest of my projects. Most of them are just simple projects that I worked on out of curiosity, mainly to explore a new concept or idea. </p>

                                    I wrote both the Mandlebrot and Julia renderers in C. I played around with rendering the fractals in various color patterns, but I settled on this greyscale version because I thought it looked the best. The programs take command-line inputs for the viewport scale and position. I wrote the fractal renderers to practice as I familiarized myself with the syntax of C.<br><br>
                                    In addition to the fractal renderers I wrote a program in C that takes 24-bit color data in the form of an array pointer and saves a bitmap file without using any extra libraries. I wrote the bitmap program while I was teaching myself C as a way to practice file I/O and simple memory management.<br><br>
                                    The example julia fractal is the fractal for c = -0.65 + 0.45i.<br>

                                <p>I have long been interested in neural networks and have wanted to try implementing one for a while. I decided to use the neural network to play a simple racing game because I thought that it was an application that wouldn't be too difficult for my first time using neural networks. I decided to use a genetic algorithm to train the network for a similar reason: I have done minimal research on how to implement neural networks and thought that a genetic algorithm would be easy to figure out for myself.</p>

                                <p>I wrote the program in <a class="GenericLink" href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>, which is a language/application that is intended to make writing simple graphical apps easy to write. Processing is essentially identical to Java since Java code will run in  Processing without modification. I do have plans to reuse this code in future Java projects...</p>

                                <p>I had the idea for this text generator a few months before I decided to try to implement it. At the time, I wasn't thinking about it in terms of a Markov-chain, but I have since decided that that is the best way to describe the way it functions.</p>
                                <p>In the training stage, the program analyzes a text document with the training data. For each character in the data, the program looks at the previous 6 characters. For each combination of 5 characters present in the data, the program keeps a tally of the number of occurrences of the character that came next. Essentially, the program creates a probability distribution of all characters based on the previous 6 characters. The number 6 is arbitrary, and the value can be assigned at runtime by a command-line argument. I chose 6 because it resulted in the best speed for how coherent the output text was. </p>

                                <p>I wrote this engine as a way to further understand 3D computer graphics. Additionally, I was learning about vectors and planes in my pre-calculus class, which is what got me to finally begin the project. I was not intending to use the program as an actual graphical engine, I just wrote it to experiment with 3D graphics and the vector math that I was learning in schoool. The program takes a single .obj as an input. The engine runs on a single processor thread in Python, as such it is very slow. I indended to add more complex lighting and reflections, but I decided not to contunue with the project, because it takes a very long time to render one frame with even slightly complex meshes even at very low resolutons. The shading of each face is based off of the angle relative to the plane of the camera.</p>
                                <p>The example is an animation of an icosphere rotating to demonstrate the engine.</p>

                                <p> I became interested in noise generation because I saw it being applied in procedural terrain and textures of the games that I played and was curious about how it worked. After researching the Perlin noise algorithm, I wrote an implementation of the algorithm in Python to understand it further. The visuals are rendered using a python library called Pygame.</p>
