                    <h1>Programming </h1>


                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>I first learned to program when I taught myself Python by following an online tutorial in 2015. I often programmed as a hobby and made simple console-based projects to mess around with programming.
                    <p>In 2017, which was my sophomore year of high school, I enrolled in my first official computer-science course. The course was based in C# and the .net framework and introduced me to more structured programming practices and more advanced concepts. I continued to write mostly in Python for my hobby projects because I was still more comfortable with the syntax.</p>
                    <p>That same year, I learned how to write BASIC for my TI-84 plus mainly as a way to program in math class. I wrote simple games, math tools, and tech demos. Some of the programs I wrote include: Snake, a program that factors quadratics, and a Mandelbrot fractal renderer.</p>
                    <p>In 2019 I began to teach myself C and C++ to familiarize myself with lower-level programming concepts, increase the number of languages knew, and gain access to a faster language for resource-heavy projects.</p>
                    <p>2019-2020 was my freshman year at Western Washington University. I was accepted into the “Computer Science Distinguished Scholars Program” and took CS 141, 145, and 241. The first of which was a Python course, which was overwhelmingly review. During CS 241 I declared the computer science pre-major.</p>

                    <p>
                        These are some of the projects that I have completed on my own time as a hobby. Most of them are just simple projects that I worked on out of curiosity, mainly to explore a new concept or idea that I had.
