                    <h3>Who I am</h3>
                    <p>I am a sophomore at Western Washington University perusing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a minor in German.</p>
                    <p>I grew up and currently live in the Seattle area of Washington state, and attended Inglemoor High School. I became interested in computer programming in middle school and enjoy programming as a hobby. See my <a class="GenericLink" href="https://dylancarroll.net/programming">programming page</a> for more information about that. I took German for four years in high school and am continuing my studies at Western.</p>
                    <p>Aside from programming, my additional hobbies include animating, writing, reading, spending time with friends and family, and playing games.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h3> Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>During my senior year of high school, I worked as a courtesy clerk at Safeway. There, I learned a lot about how to work well with others in a workplace setting, and especially about retail workers.</p>
                    <p>This year, I worked as a Resident Advisor for Western Washington Univeristy.</p>
